# Contributing

To contribute to the tea time club webpage:

## 1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

1.1 **If you wish to remain anonymous**: consider using a fresh email from [Proton Mail](proton.me). This won't make you completely untracable by any means, but will give you privacy from prying eyes.

1.2 **If you wish to be untracable**: this guide doesn't currently cover that. If it's something you'd like help doing you should reach out and we'll see what guidance we can put together.

> 🐦‍⬛ WaffleCrow: I decided to create an account that is anonymous because I prefer having a reasonable expectation of privacy. It wouldn't be impossible for GitHub or state actors to figure out
> who I am, but I don't really care about that here. I'm mostly trying to keep ill-spirited randos online from trying to doxx me. This is good enough for me!

    
## 2. Ask a member of the club to add your account to the Tea Time Club organization.

## 3. Browse the website source

You can find the source files for the website here: [link](https://github.com/Tea-Time-Club/Tea-Time-Club/tree/main/src). The website is written in something called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

If you modify the website files or add new ones: they will get built automatically and become available on [https://tea-time-club.github.io/Tea-Time-Club/](https://tea-time-club.github.io/Tea-Time-Club/).

To make edits I reccomend doing that in your browser. You can click the pencil icon on any file to modify it and then commit your changes. To add new files there is an Add Files button in folders as you browse them.
